    "1. Who developed python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Guido van Rossum developed python programming language and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Python is an interpreted programming language which supports object-oriented,structured and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Yes python is a case sensitive language,it consider uppercase and lowercase characters differently.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:- i) Presence of third-party modules \n",
    "ii) Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc.) \n",
    "iii) Open source and large active community base \n",
    "iv) Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write\n",
    "v) User-friendly data structures \n",
    "vi) High-level language \n",
    "vii) Dynamically typed language\n",
    "viii) Object-Oriented and Procedural Programming language\n",
    "ix) Portable and Interactive\n",

    "16. Is indentetion required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Yes,indentetion is very important in python because python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.In other programming \n",
    "languages is only for readablity but in python is for recognize the block of codes.\n",
